"""Build the project documentation: API reference (Doxygen) + site (MkDocs).

Doxygen writes the API reference into docs/api (generated, ignored by git);
MkDocs then builds the whole docs/ directory into build/docs/site.
Both tools treat problems as errors: an undocumented public entity fails
Doxygen (WARN_AS_ERROR), a broken link fails MkDocs (--strict).

Usage:
    python automation/build_docs.py
    python automation/build_docs.py --serve   # local preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
